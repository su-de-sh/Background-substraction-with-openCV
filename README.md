# BackGroundSubstraction with Opencv

BackGroundSubstraction is a computer vision technique that allows computer to detect any change in the frame of a video. Using this 
technique we can make motion detection applications and many more. Basically it can be used as classical technique in people counting
in supermarket or any public place with static camera where there is continuous moment of people and also in securities to detect if 
there is any motion inside the locked room/house. 

## Getting Started

To have this code running into your local machine you can just download or clone it to your machine and fire up the terminal into the same 
directory where this file is and just hit the command:: python BackGroundSubtraction.py.
If everything goes good you can expect two windows showing original frame and masked frame 
with background substraction.
